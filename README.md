HOW TO USE:



Install Tampermonkey from your Browser extensionstore

Click on "Create new userscript" drag the .js file into the textbox click File -> Save and fire up Pokeclicker.com the button "should" appear above the map whenever you loaded your savefile.




This is not made to look perfect in any way and is entirely for learning purposes.

I comment out any unsave features that could harm your savefile if you wish to use them take a look at the script and uncomment them.
I'll include a description of why they're unsave so use at your own risk.

I'd still recommend to create a new save to cheat on never cheat on your main save!
I am not responsible for your save if anything breaks.
